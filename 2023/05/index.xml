      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time in 2016 or 2017, I needed a way to match file paths with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;glob patterns&lt;/a&gt;. The trick was that it had to work in a filter driver running in the Windows kernel. There weren&amp;rsquo;t a lot of ready-to-use libraries that were kernel-ready. In fact I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any, so I wrote my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, I wrote an implementation in C which was very Windows-centric, and didn&amp;rsquo;t hold to the syntactic rules from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;glob(7) man page&lt;/a&gt;. It was sufficient for the job, but I wanted to revisit the problem and create something more generally useful. I uploaded &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbc60/glob&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an implementation in Go on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that holds to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;glob(7)&lt;/a&gt; rules, is very efficient, and runs in user space on both Windows and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Go module accepts the &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; wildcard (to match directory paths recursively) as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;normal wildcards&lt;/a&gt;. When I originally researched how to go about building a pattern-matching function, I looked for existing code to get an idea of how to structure a solution. I hoped that I could find an open-source library where I could just transliterate the code from whatever language it was written to C (without any calls to the standard library, because that&amp;rsquo;s not a thing within the Windows kernel). All the examples I could find were either limited to the standard wildcards or had exponential behavior, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.swtch.com/glob&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Russ Cox so eloquently discussed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking about the shape of glob patterns. Simple patterns, made up of literal strings, the &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; wildcard, and character classes, are matched character-by-character (with a little extra processing for character classes). The &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; pattern matches zero-or-more characters followed by whatever simple pattern follows it. So &lt;code&gt;abc*xyz&lt;/code&gt; is a glob composed of a simple pattern, &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt;, followed by a zero-or-more pattern &lt;code&gt;*xyz&lt;/code&gt;. The latter pattern is called a &lt;em&gt;directory pattern&lt;/em&gt;, because it&amp;rsquo;s limited to matching file and directory names within a single directory. Directory patterns amount to specifying a loop that consumes a character (except a path separator) every time the simple pattern that follows it fails to match some portion of a path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; patterns, &lt;em&gt;recursive patterns&lt;/em&gt;, can be thought of requiring a loop that consumes any character that isn&amp;rsquo;t matched by whatever pattern follows it. The trick here is to realize that &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; can be followed by a simple pattern and zero-or-more directory patterns. If at any point during the matching process the simple pattern or any of the directory patterns that may follow it fail, then processing continues by allowing &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; to consume one character from the path and then matching the path to the pattern restarts from that point. This is still an $O(n)$ process, because each iteration makes progress through the path until either the whole pattern and path are consumed, or a match cannot be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This realization, that recursive patterns are made up of simple and directory patterns, led to a relatively simple algorithm and a fast implementation. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbc60/glob&#34; class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; for the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated 2023-11-12: spelling, grammar and to clarify how recursive patterns are processed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
