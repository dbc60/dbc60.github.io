      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you live in the United States of America, please vote! Election Day is Tuesday, November 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vote for whomever you like, but understand that Trump is tearing apart our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He lied to us Americans about the deadliness of COVID-19 and how easliy it spreads. Now well over 200,000 Americans are dead. Many of those deaths could have been prevented if we had been forewarned and taken precautions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He has failed the economy. Many small businesses are failing and may not recover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He ripped apart immigrant families and there are now over 500 immigrant children who can&amp;rsquo;t be reunited with their parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He bullies, denigrates, and belittles people who disagree with him or are less powerful than he is so he can feel superior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He refuses to denounce white supremacists and actually commanded one group to &amp;ldquo;stand back and stand by&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really want him to be our president? I don&amp;rsquo;t understand how that&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
