      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am truly saddened by the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning to find that Donald Trump is our president elect. I feel really awful about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our national anthem declares America as &amp;ldquo;the land of the free and the home of the brave.&amp;rdquo; While we don&amp;rsquo;t always live up to that ideal, it&amp;rsquo;s something we strive for. It&amp;rsquo;s something we are all proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve elected as our next president a person who bullies people. He&amp;rsquo;s denigrated those with disabilities. He abuses women. He spreads fear and hate based on race and religion, and wraps it in spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hoped more people were unwilling to overlook the pain, suffering and fear he spreads and see him for what he is - a hateful, dangerous person who cares for nothing but himself. Instead, he will become our next leader. Good luck to us all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
